# Azure DNS

DNS is at the heart of any digital communication. Azure DNS is the service that will function as an alternative to the existing DNS solution that you may use or be familiar with. Your zone and records are stored in Azure, and the name servers that respond to the DNS queries are distributed globally across the Azure Data centers.
