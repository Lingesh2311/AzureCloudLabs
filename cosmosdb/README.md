## Azure CosmosDB

This is a globally distributed multimodal database provided by Azure that supports primarily five APIs (Core SQL, Cassandra, Gremlin, MongoDB, and Table API).

This folder contains the exercises to build a cosmosdb web app.

We can use the following command to install the necessary packages

```python
pip install --user pydocumentdb
```

Then, we can run each sample using the following command:

```python
python create_cosmosdb.py
```
